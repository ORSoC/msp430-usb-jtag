//// This file contains functions to control the power management ////
//// IC TPS65217 from Texas Instruments.                          ////
//// It uses swi2cmst.h and swi2cmst.c for I2C communtication     ////
//// with the device.                                             ////
////                                                              ////
//// Description                                                  ////
//// Implementation according to ref [1].                         ////
////                                                              ////
//// Usage                                                        ////
//// 1. Initialize the I2C bus by calling swi2cmst_init() in      ////
///     swi2cmst.c.                                               ////
//// 2. Optional: Clear potentially hung I2C slaves by calling    ////
////    swi2cmst_clrbus(). Not guaranteed to work on all slaves.  ////
////    Slaves may be hung if the CPU/MCU was reset during an     ////
////    ongoing I2C transaction. There may also be other reasons. ////
//// 3. Perform accesses to TPS65217 by calling one or more of    ////
////    tps65217_chipId(), tps65217_wrReg(), tps65217_rdReg().    ////
////                                                              ////
